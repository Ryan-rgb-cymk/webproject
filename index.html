    <p>The comic series Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson ran for ten years under the Universal Syndicate, being 
    published in over 2400 newspapers in at least 50 countries. Richly complex and beautifully 
    simple, Watterson's comic plays between imagination and reality, optimism and cinicism, and whimsy 
    and sincerity as it follows proud and exasperating 6-year-old Calvin and his toy tiger Hobbes, 
    who comes to life to support and antagonize him.</p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Watterson didn't want to clutter his comic with lots of characters, but rather keep it centered 
    on Calvin and Hobbes and just include a few people immediately around him, each filling a different 
    role.
